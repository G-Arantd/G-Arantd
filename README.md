# ABOUT ME

## Profile
My name is Gabriel Arantd Felipe and as a student of Analysis and Systems Development, my main expertise lies in Python development.
I use Flask for efficient API building and Pandas for data manipulation.

I have intermediate knowledge of React for developing dynamic interfaces in web applications.
Although my knowledge is intermediate, I am constantly learning to deal with more complex applications.

In parallel, I learned the basics of Golang's functioning,
where I learned concepts of ORM and OOP.

For data manipulation and visualization, I am a proponent of tools like Google Data Studio,
which contribute to the creation of informative and intuitive dashboards.

For leisure, I enjoy playing Minecraft, dedicating part of my free time to creating experiences for the game.
Whether developing Mods, Maps, Minigames, or other mechanics that contribute to the user experience.
A way to use my creativity, resulting in unique and fun experiences with my friends and the Minecraft community.
